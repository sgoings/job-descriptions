# DevTools Engineer, Deis

<< common.md >>

## You Might Be

1. A champion of industry best practices such as:

  - continuous integration
  - continuous delivery
  - automated testing
  - 12 factor applications

2. A scrupulous process observer with a desire to remove manual steps from other
engineers' day to day workflow in order to reduce hindrances in achieving
[flow][flow].

3. A product _and_ people centric engineer. You ponder ways to create
a [better user experience][joelux] as well as lower the barrier to entry for
open source contributors who might just take your software to a level never
before imagined.

4. An avid learner. You like keeping abreast on a wide variety of subjects.
Computers are great, but they're only one of your interests.

## The Duties

The Deis team loves creating components that the open source community at large
can seamlessly plug into their existing toolsets and workflows. In order to
maintain the user experience people have come to expect with the Deis product
offerings, we need someone to help us further refine our:

### 1. Developer Tooling

First and foremost you'll get to work with and improve the [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
ecosystem. You'll tie projects together with tools like [glide][glide],
[wercker][wercker], and make. You'll use open source provisioning toolkits such
as [rigger][rigger] which use [Terraform][terraform] under the hood. When you
decide to break out of the mold and write a new tool, you'd be writing in
Golang, Shell, Make, and Python.

### 2. Automated Testing

You'll bolster our unit, functional, and end to end test suites using bare metal
and cloud providers such as [Amazon AWS][aws], [Digital Ocean][do],
[Google Container Engine][gke], and [Microsoft Azure][azure].
You might also use the [Ginkgo BDD testing Framework][ginkgo] but then again
you're not afraid to pull out the bash bazooka to prove applications do
(or don't do) what they promise.

### 3. CI/CD Systems

You'll jump across a few CI systems like [Travis CI][travis] and
[Jenkins][jenkins] to deliver packages and binaries to [Docker Hub][dockerhub],
[Quay.io][quay], and [Bintray][bintray].

### 4. Release Management Techniques

You'll keep a close eye on the full software development lifecycle to find and
remove inefficiencies in the delivery pipeline.
